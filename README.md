#### I'll take this from an AWS standpoint. Tool of choice would still be terraform, yes.
- Set up terraform backend on S3
- Set up terraform workspaces for each developer
- Have a production and staging infra, which are managed by Jenkins (or other tool) jobs running your terraform files
- Provision basics: VPC, as many private subnets as useful to your region, and a public subnet as a SSH bastion and a NAT gateway.
- Provision security items and backing infra such as RDS, S3, IAM roles etc
- Provision your actual application environment - here I'll assume kubernetes for convenience. Ideally this is a mix of spot, reserved and on-demand EC2 instances to keep costs low.
- Setup monitoring and alerting with Cloudwatch and Prometheus (operator is great)
- Set up log collection (either TICK or ELK).
- Deploy the application (which I don't believe is part of the question, but I need to include this for step 10)
- Include autoscaling (HPA and cluster autoscaler if you're on k8s), adjust requests and limits based on usage of your application - you should have all the data you need to make these decisions from the earlier steps
- Not quite "a" server anymore but this I believe will put you in a good position for your application!

#### "We're launching a new product and we need the infrastructure deployed. Explain how you would do this and detail the various components."
- I'm going to assume you are on the cloud, since you can't have a good idea of exactly how many servers you need to calculate a 3-year ROI.
> From an operations point of view, I'd be looking at server size (CPU, RAM, Disk),
  - Yawn, those are just the "instance-type" pulldown. You shouldn't care what the values are, because they will change as the developer figure things out.
> load balancing, redundancy, some kind of failover, DNS, security etc.
  - Yup, don't forget monitoring and alerting.
> I've also got a good idea of what CI/CD is.
  - Do you? You supplied a lot of links, but didn't summarize what you would do. And is CI/CD only for the application, or does it apply to the infrastructure too?
> I guess what I'm looking for is a generic architecture checklist
  - There is no perfect 'generic' architecture. But the question asked for "infrastructure", and you only painted a picture for a server. What about databases? What about async jobs? What about caching? CDN?

> "We're launching a new product and we need the infrastructure deployed. Explain how you would do this and detail the various components."
- My answer:

  - First, let's make sure you really need this. Most products should probably start with a PaaS like Heroku or GCE/GKE, or Lambda. Don't pay for people to muck with servers if you don't need to. Most apps are not so unique that they need unique infrastructure.
  - Ok, if you think you need servers. Great. Let's architect this for best practices: 12-factor apps, infrastructure as code, immutable infrastructure, and deploy pipelines.
  - There are lots of ways to get there (Netflix stuff, CloudFoundry), but my favorite is Kubernetes. This gives a nice dotted line between Developers and Operators. Developers think of things "inside the container", plus the application linkages between the services. Ops thinks about boxes and alerting.
  - There should be automation that builds + deploys all the infrastructure + code to the staging AWS account, then once it passes tests, runs it all in the production account. Developers can spin up temporary environments in their own account, but it gets burned to the ground every night.
  - You should be able to run the chaos monkey (and/or gorilla if the biz needs it), and let it kill off any server in production. You should not need to SSH into your infrastructure, except for occasional debug sessions. All changes should be done in a branch in Git, and preferably peer reviewed before merging.
  - Your infrastructure + application should be entirely defined in a few Git repos. Each master branch should 'deploy itself' to production after a commit (with a manual approval step at first.) For anything that isn't 100% magic like that, you should have a Runbook that ensures anyone on the team can perform that work (perform a database fail-over, bounce the applications, block an IP, etc.)
  - For a small team, if you'd like to keep infrastructure management down, I might recommend using ECS with Fargate to run all your containers, and then using RDS to run your DB. For automated deployments, its kind of up to you. Maybe CodePipeline, maybe Jenkins, maybe Drone or something else.

-----------------------------------------------------

We use Fargate, and its great for avoiding having to maintain EC2 infrastructure. However you should know:
- Fargate is pricey
- You no longer get access to the underlying infrastructure
- No volume mounts

Everyone's use cases are different but this has worked well for my company.
- When deploying a new service it will be hosted on the following (in order of preference)
- Lambda While in the free tier, dirt cheap to free. If performance is not an issue and workloads are light to medium we prefer lambda.
- When we hit performance constraints we move to 2. Fargate Fargate allows us to execute long running taske similar to lambda but for us these are usually tasks > lambda 5 min window. These usually run in the background If performance and uptime is of utmost importance 3. ECS Its not kubernetes but it gets the job done.
- We use a mixture of terraform and serverless framework depending on the use case.
 
#### 5 independent cloud services
  - backblaze for storage
  - cloudflare/other cdn
  - databricks/floydhub for ml
  - packet.net for everything else
  - Sendgrid
  - Gitlab
  - PagerDuty

I would suggest that you pick something (maybe a statically generated blog) and start using these technologies to host it (and learning as you go). I'd suggest this order:

- Buy a VPS (shared kernel) -- just to see what people in environments where shared kernel is OK (this is normally the usecase of wordpress/other framework centric plans), note what you can and can't install, how you can get past requirements by locally building software from source, etc.
- Buy a VPS (KVM) -- know the difference between KVM (along the way you'll probably learn about qemu and virtualbox, know how they differ)
- Buy a full dedicated server -- learn a tiny bit about what happens when you need beefier hardware (I recommend hetzner's robot marketplace), and the benefits of being able to run it yourself.
- Buy a domain name (you can use AWS or Cloudflare or my personal favorite Gandi.net)
- Learn about A/AAAA/CNAME/TXT/MX records, enough to point your domain name at the IP for the server you bought, for the appropriate subdomain(s)
- Deploy the blog (or whatever project you choose) to the server (whichever one you chose) by copying the code and running a process that binds to port 80
- Deploy the blog to the server by running a process that copies the code, runs it but binds to another port (let's say 8080 or 8000), and is reverse-proxied to by NGINX (which is listening @ port 80)
- Deploy the blog to the server with the NGINX-proxied setup, but this time use systemd to make the process an enabled service that starts up when the server starts -- you should be able to restart your server now and have the blog come up.
- Deploy the blog to the server by running the process with docker (remember, docker is just sandboxed/isolated processes). For extra points here, figure out how to make docker and systemd process management to play nice, CoreOS has some good blog posts on this IIRC.
- To flex your Docker chops, have NGINX actually run from a container (not as an installed system-level program), pointing at the other container.
- Completely wipe/reset your server, and make your way to the NGINX-powered setup with Ansible. The only part Ansible might not be able to do right away is getting you a machine, but ansible has provisioning so that's kind of a lie (but one that's kind of OK to tell yourself at first).
- Attempt to start learning Kubernetes by reading through the concepts, setting up a cluster the hard way
- Get your blog up and running on k8s
- Teardown your cluster completely, then use kubeadm to rebuild it -- you should be writing config in a manner that once you have a cluster up you can just point at it, and run scripted kubectl commands .
- Teardown your cluster completely, build it back up again kops to try on AWS.
- Try and deploy an application with storage requirements/more ambitious requirements.


My list would be:

- Ansible
- Prometheus
- Kubernetes
- CI/CD (not just CI/CD, but specifically Jenkins declarative Pipelines)
  - despite downvotes, jenkins is what youâ€™ll be working with in 60+% of companies. at least learn your way around.
- Ansible - easy learning curve. Python - as above, and allows extension of Ansible. CentOS and Ubuntu - two major players. Docker Terraform AWS + GCP (in equal measures)
- Terraform is darn fun, I would learn it first


I'm on a 4 person team. We use a combination of GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins. Jenkins has become mostly a way to manage automated jobs that don't necessarily relate to a deployment process. We pretty much use GitLab exclusively for deploying changes to staging and then production environments using Puppet. We also run a pretty even split right now between Windows and Linux systems, with Linux starting to take over a bit more of the mix. This is such a critical piece of our process that everyone on the team is expected to know how to develop for, run, and troubleshoot the pipelines. Obviously each of us has a higher skill level in certain areas. I am the PowerShell/C#/JS, networking, and unit testing Guru. We have another guy who is the Ruby and Git guru, etc. But we all have skills in the same areas and are competent enough to get by. But everyone is responsible for the build process as it's a core competency for how we work.

We were inspired by the Phoenix Project and then read Jez Humble's CI book and we started with simple things that made our lives easier. First we just got to know and understand Jenkins and Git and automated some of the daily chores that were of zero value to us (like account renewals for JV staff) and eventually got to the point where we were running automated unit tests and builds on our in-house tools. From these we started with Puppet. We took our most fragile and least understood system (build by a third party in a language none of us knows well) and completely puppetized it. Then we connected it to a GitLab CD pipeline. From these we added in our Sensu monitoring and then added all of our production systems into Puppet for Sensu. Once we had the confidence that we knew what we were doing and were on the right track we started with other services that problematic for us in some way. Eventually the process improved to the point that we actually had time to start working on engineering integrations and performance improvements. Our systems are monitored, documented (the pipeline code is the documentation), and we don't get crap alerts at night any more. For us I believe the key was starting on something that made us all see the benefit. The first time we got the pipeline to spin up a completely new system and just build itself from a GitLab code push one of my workmates shook his head and his voice cracked when he said, "This changes everything. Everything." And we never looked back.

It's definitely a different way of thinking. What sort of environment are you working in? Mostly Windows? What was revolutionary for me was learning that I could leverage PowerShell unit testing (Pester) to not just unit test the build code but to also perform the integration testing. So when a pipeline goes from code validation (unit tests, style checking, etc) I can leverage the same processes to actually verify that the system did what we expected it to and export it to a dashboard. So I can be sure that my code is manipulating the inputs correctly (unit tests with mocks) and then I can see that the VMs were built to the specs we desired, code was deployed, etc (integration testing).

Start small. Then add more to it. The most important thing at each step is that you are sure it is a completely deterministic system. You should know that it can only be poked in so many ways and what will happen when it gets poked. If that makes sense...

For our first project we first made sure that we could ensure that the tools we required to run the app were all installed on the system. So here was how we went.

1. Can we have Puppet domain join the server, install nano, Git, Ruby, MySQL etc on the server?

2. Can puppet make sure that the code is present on the server?

3. Can Puppet actually configure the web app to run?

4. Can Puppet configure the reverse proxy with an SSL redirect?

5. Can Puppet restore the DB backup if the DB is not already present on the system?

6. Can Puppet install Sensu checks/metrics?

OK, now we have the system fully up and running on a clean, up-to-date system (previously it was on server 2003 and we had no idea how it worked or was built), can we connect it to GitLab so that GitLab can push changes to Puppet?

7. Create a CI/CD pipeline from Git to Puppet to the existing VM.

8. Create a staging environment and a Git branch called staging so code is first pushed there.

9. Dynamically build the VM for the staging environment and run automated tests before the code can be pushed to production.

Each step on the path brought us value. Initially we knew nothing about the system. So going through the process of Puppetizing it got us valuable documentation. Your situation is not likely the same but you probably have a fragile system in your environment that you can take and do something similar to. Even if it is just getting the configuration documented and put into version control. Take small steps that you are pretty sure will succeed. Chain them together into something bigger as yo gain experience and confidence. You can't do everything at once. Small changes compounded over time make huge results.

Make sure you check out Pluralsight. I have had a subscription to them for several years now and they have courses on Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, unit testing, etc. Udemy is nice but the a la carte pricing can be a bit rough if you want to watch a lot of courses... On the other hand, if you aren't watching anything a subscription plan sucks, too...

I would use Ansible:

- Versioning - All edits to your playbooks are version controlled
- Deployments are defined as code - Makes changes trivial and quick
- Desired configruation - Rerun a playbook to bring a machine back into compliance.
- Every deployment is up-to-date

You could use a combo:

- Ansible to build a "master" image then deploy that image, this offsets the deployment time problem of builds with just Ansible BUT brings added overheads such as:
- storage requirements for images
- required "refresh" intervals to update the images.

Ansible (or some other tools of automation that can condense Infrastructure as Code) brings some benefits to the table:

You "pay" for the number of different bakes you need, not for the total number of "machines" dealt with (as with baking different images and cloning them after). But
- forking and extending gets significantly easier, and
- code (YAML files or playbooks) can be stored in a code repository, so you can actually blame changes and roll back if anything breaks.
- And after you tune your configuration playbooks, you can continue with more configuration playbooks: the same tool allows you to handle additional administration tasks.

But if you dockerize, I see how that could turn irrelevant. Still it makes a lot of sense in physical machines and VM's.

If you don't have the time, or your team doesn't/isn't likely to take care in this regards, you may be better with VM's. Packer exists for a reason. You could certainly still use Docker for development as it makes the architecture much more repeatable and documents it as code, even if it's not the final product in production.

Small shop or not, one of the side effects of using containers is how they force you to follow certain design patterns. When those patterns aren't followed and things break, the answer isn't to stop using the technology -- it's to encourage sharing of knowledge and better understanding of that technology.

A lot of negativity around Docker is based on misunderstandings, misuse, and a dislike of the implementation. While there are pros and cons with any technology, I have yet to encounter a scenario where VMs provided a better all around solution to containers. Once you embrace Docker (or containerization in general) for what it is, you find yourself applying its usage patterns without even thinking about it.

Docker certainly isn't a silver bullet, but:

- it can be the sole dependency of a project

- it encourages environment-agnostic applications

- it can speed up onboarding of new developers

- its supported by a number of orchestration frameworks: compose, swarm, ECS, Kubernetes, etc.

Sometimes those alone provide enough benefit to use Docker over plain VMs.

Why not both? Both solve different problems. (Although there's some overlap.)

As for development prospective - both approach are good and Jetbrains products have good support for both cases. If you choose VM over Docker you should also look at Vagrant. In another case I suggest you to familiarize with docker-compose.

With Docker it is easy to spin up different environments, tear down, rebuild, share, etc.

Make sure you setup persistent storage and you won't run into storage issues.

For deployments on large scale containers are the future. Find the right framework, ie swarm or kubernetes, that works for you and enjoy the benefits of high availability, auto scalingand self healing. The fact you made a mistake just tells you you need to change the way you setup and operate the containers nothing else. And don't beat yourself up for what you did, remember only people that work make mistakes.

What was the data stored in? You should really aim to have your containers be stateless so this is a non-issue. If they canâ€™t be stateless, mount the data directories with a -v so the important data is persisted on the underlying host machine. As others have pointed out, this same thing can happen with VMs. You just need to take the correct precautions.

For starters, using containers without some kind of orchestrator managing them (e.g. Kubernetes or Docker Swarm) will lead to more issues over time wrt containers going down/data going missing.

As for the containers vs VMs debate, it depends. VMs can do what containers do and simplify a lot of the operational overhead that comes with running many containers at once (esp. around networking, storage and security), but they are bigger, less portable (think: VMware vs Xen vs KVM,) and take longer to deploy.

Containers are smaller and make it much easier to deploy an app consistently on many different kinds of hardware (if your app allows for it, i.e. it doesn't have any dependencies on the host it runs on). This means that developers don't have to worry as much about the underlying hardware than they do in the case of VMs. However, running lots of them requires a tool like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to keep track of it all, and getting primitives like networking, storage and inter/intra-process communication right are "more" difficult than they are in the VM world. As well, with the exception of OpenShift (to an extent), administrating containers requires a much higher comfort level with the command line than VMs do. This tends to be challenging for many of the teams I work with that use the command line "as needed."

I normally advocate for containers because most apps don't need an entire VM to run on, which allows development teams to spend less time worrying about hardware and infrastructure and more time on making apps better. However, making apps that work well in an ecosystem like this involves cultural changes around the way teams typically write and deploy software. Because of this and the fact that most big companies are already deeply invested in virtualization, I usually recommend keeping VMs in the short term (using something like Vagrant to manage their deployment) and focussing on making "the process" right so that the move to containers "just makes sense."
